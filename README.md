Word Rank Puzzle

A certain word is a permutation of the set of letters that comprise it. With a word's set of letters, other words can be created. For example, STATIONARILY/ANTIROYALIST are two words comprised of the same letters. Each word has their own 'rank', which is its alphabetical placement among its fellow permutations. Some examples are below:

ABAB = 2

AAAB = 1

BAAA = 4

QUESTION = 24572

BOOKKEEPER = 10743


Write a program which takes a word as a command line argument and prints to standard output its rank.
